        <h3>Description</h3>

        <div class="col-md-12">
            Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based,
            object-oriented,[12] and specifically designed to have as few implementation
            dependencies as
            possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere"
            (WORA),[13] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
            without the need for recompilation.[14] Java applications are typically compiled to
            bytecode
            that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As
            of
            2015, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,[15][16][17][18]
            particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million
            developers.[citation needed] Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun
            Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995
            as a
            core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its
            syntax
            from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
